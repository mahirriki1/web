    <h2>What is PC Gaming?</h2>
    <p>
      PC gaming is as simple as it sounds, playing games on a personal computer. First, I'll talk about what PC games are. PC games, also can be referred to as a computer game, 
      is a type of video game that is played on a computer. This is different from a console game because console games made for consoles. PC games are cool because of the 
      characteristics that define it. PC games are more diverse usually because there is a very diverse amount of personal computers that are available. 
      Some may be faster than others, being able to run a big game like <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home">Fortnite</a> or a 
      game like <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> with shaders. PC games became popular after the <a href="https://www.bugsplat.com/blog/video-games/great-video-game-crash-1983/">Video Game Crash of 1983</a>. 
      In terms of gaming, Newzoo, the global provider of game analytics, reported that the PC gaming is the third-largest platform for gaming as of 2016. From all of this, 
      you can probably tell that PC gaming has become more and more popular over the years. As PC gaming became more popular, PC part prices gradually spiked up. To get started with PC gaming,
      building a gaming PC is the best start to it. The next section of this website will talk about how to choose your PC parts and when to buy them.

    <h2>Your PC</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to build a gaming PC, you have come to the right place. Although it may look overwhelming at first, picking parts for your PC is a breeze. The best way to do this is
      by using <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/">PCPartPicker</a>. On this website, you will be able to pick the PC parts you want and organize it nicely. So how do you pick your
      PC parts? The best way to do this is by knowing what games you want to play on your PC. If you want to play big games such as Rust or Cyberpunk, you will need better parts. The first
      thing you can pick on PCPartPicker is the CPU. The CPU is essentially the brain of the computer and is the most important part of your computer. 
      It processes the instructions that come from programs. There are two types: AMD and Intel. The difference between AMD and Intel processors is that AMD is better
      at multitasking while Intel processors are better at handling single-thread tasks like video editing, modeling, graphics heavy games, etc. CPU coolers usually come with the CPU when bought
      so I would recommend not putting anything there unless you want to play really extreme games. Next up, the motherboard. The motherboard is basically the foundation of the computer. Without it, nothing works.
      Choosing a motherboard, however, is pretty hard. You would need to first choose a CPU before you choose the motherboard because there are different types. Intel and AMD processors have different chipsets so choosing
      the wrong motherboard will be a really bad thing to do. If you go with the AMD Ryzen processors, go with a B450M motherboard. I recommend getting this motherboard from Gigabyte because their motherboards are ready to go.
      Intel motherboards are a bit different. Make sure the motherboard you choose is for an Intel processor and not an AMD processor. Next up is memory. Memory, or also called RAM, is important to your PC build. You want to make sure
      to get RAM that is overclockable and is 8 GB or above. 8 GB of RAM is the bare minumum for RAM and you could play games on it without multitasking but if you want a better gaming experience and be able to multitask with ease,
      get 16 GB of RAM or more. Storage is simple to understand. There's 3 types of storage devices: solid-state drive (SSD), hard drive (HDD), and the M.2 SSD. The SSD is usually more expensive than a HDD but is faster than the HDD. 
      The HDD is better for storing high capacity stuff like games but is slower than the SSD. A M.2 SSD is another form factor for SSDs and are faster but more expensive. Since you are building a gaming PC, go with a HDD with 500 GB+ for game storage
      and an SSD or a M.2 SSD with 256 GB on it for Windows files. Of course, you don't have to use my recommended storage amounts. The video card is crucial to gaming. The video card, also known as the graphics card, is what produces the image you see on your monitor.
      Getting a graphics card is optional if your CPU has integrated graphics in it but it is highly recommended that you get an external one. AMD and Nvidia both make graphics cards. AMD GPU's are a bit better than Nvidia cards but Nvidia cards have better DX11/OpenGL drivers.
      It is up to you to which one you get and which one best pairs with your CPU. The case is also essential if you want your gaming PC to look nice. Make sure to get a case that is able to fit your motherboard and graphics card.
      The power supply is another crucial part of your system. Without it, you will not be able to use your computer. PCPartPicker tells you an estimate of how much watts your computer will comsume. Using the watts from PCPartPicker, find a power supply that supports that many watts
      plus more watts to keep room for upgradability. That is pretty much it for building a PC. Don't forget to buy a monitor as well or else you won't be able to see the content of you PC!

    <h2>Games to Play</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you have your gaming PC parts picked out and are ready to order, you might want some game recommendations. Here are a few:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Rainbow Six Siege:</b> Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is an online tactical shooter made by Ubisoft. The game is a team strategy game so communicating with your teammates is crucial. There are two teams in the game: the attackers and defenders. The attackers' main goal is to defuse the bomb
        while trying to get through all the enemies' gadgets and traps. The defenders try to defend the bomb with reinforced walls which cant be broken and traps. This game is one of my favorite games and I highly recommend it.</li>
        <li><b>VALORANT:</b> VALORANT is a tactical FPS game that requires the communication of your teammates. The players play as a team of 5 against another team of 5 each with a player having an agent. One of the teams' main goal is to plant the bomb, while the other team has to protect the planting sites
        and defuse the bomb if planted. This game is also one of my favorites and I highly recommend it.</li>
        <li><b>Minecraft:</b> Minecraft is a sandbox video game made by Notch and now owned by Microsoft. In Minecraft, you explore a blocky, 3-D generated infinite world where you mine and build things to survive and win. "Winning" in Minecraft is when you kill the Ender Dragon but there's much more to do after killing
        the dragon. Theres a lot of items in the game and is really fun to explore. There's also servers which allow you to play with others or your friends. I've recently been really addicted to Minecraft and personally recommend everyone to get the game.</li>
      </ul>
      These are just a few games you can play. Theres so many more which you can explore on <a href="https://www.steam.com/">Steam</a> or any other game launchers. Have fun gaming!
